<h3><a name="defjabaconf" id="defjabaconf"></a>JABAWS Configuration </h3>
<p>There are three parts of the system you can configure. The local
and the cluster engines, and the paths to the individual executables for
each engine. These settings are stored in configuration files
within the web application directory (for an overview, then take a
look at the <a href="#warfile">war file content table</a>). </p>
<p>Initially, JABAWS is configured with only the local engine
  enabled, with job output written to directory called &quot;jobsout&quot;
  within the web application itself. This means that JABAWS will work
  out of the box, but may not be suitable for serving a whole lab or
  a university.</p>
<h3><a name="locEngConf" id="locEngConf"></a>Local Engine Configuration</h3>

<p>The Local execution engine configuration is defined in the
properties file <span class="hightlight">conf/Engine.local.properties. </span>The supported
configuration settings are:<br />
 <span class="hightlight">engine.local.enable=true</span> - #
enable or disable local engine, valid values true | false<br />
 <span class=
"hightlight">local.tmp.directory=D:\\clusterengine\\testoutput</span>
- a directory to use for temporary files storage, optional,
defaults to java temporary directory<br />
 <span class="hightlight">engine.local.thread.number=4</span> -
Number of threads for tasks execution (valid values between 1 and
2x cpu. Where x is a number of cores available in the system).
Optional defaults to the number of cores for core number &lt;=4 and
number of cores-1 for greater core numbers.</p>

<p>If the local engine going to be heavily loaded (which is often the case if you do not have a cluster) it is a good idea to increase
the amount of memory available for the web application server. If
you are using Apache-Tomcat, then you can define its memory
settings in the JAVA_OPTS environment variable. To specify which
JVM to use for Apache-Tomcat, put the full path to the JRE
installation in the JAVA_HOME environment variable (We would
recommend using Sun Java Virtual Machine (JVM) in preference to
Open JDK). Below is an example of code which can be added to <span
class="hightlight">&lt;tomcat_dir&gt;/bin/setenv.sh</span> script
to define which JVM to use and a memory settings for Tomcat server.
Tomcat server startup script (<span class=
"hightlight">catalina.sh</span>) will execute <span class=
"hightlight">setenv.sh</span> on each server start
automatically.<br />
 <span class="code">export
JAVA_HOME=/homes/ws-dev2/jdk1.6.0_17/<br />
 export JAVA_OPTS=&quot;-server -Xincgc -Xms512m -Xmx1024m&quot;</span></p>

<h3><a name="clustEngConf" id="clustEngConf"></a>Cluster Engine Configuration</h3>

<p>Supported configuration settings:<br />
 <span class="hightlight">engine.cluster.enable=true</span> - #
enable or disable local engine true | false, defaults to
false<br />
 <span class=
"hightlight">cluster.tmp.directory=/homes/clustengine/testoutput-</span>
a directory to use for temporary files storage. The value must be
an absolute path to the temporary directory. Required. The value
must be different from what is defined for local engine. This
directory must be accessible from all cluster nodes.<br />
 For the cluster engine to work, the SGE_ROOT and LD_LIBRARY_PATH
environment variables have to be defined. They tell the cluster
engine where to find DRMAA libraries. These variables
should be defined when the web application server starts up, e.g.</p>

<p class="code">SGE_ROOT=/gridware/sge<br />
 LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/gridware/sge/lib/lx24-amd64</p>

<p>Finally, do not forget to configure executables for the cluster
execution, they may be the same as for the local execution but may
be different. Please refer to the executable configuration section
for further details.</p>

<h3><a name="exec" id="exec"></a>Executable Configuration</h3>

<p>All the executable programs
are configured in <span class="hightlight">conf/Executable.properties</span> file. Each executable
is configured with a number of options. They are: <span class=
"code">local.X.bin.windows=&lt;path to executable under windows
system, optional&gt;<br />
 local.X.bin=&lt;path to the executable under non-windows system,
optional&gt;<br />
 cluster.X.bin=&lt;path to the executable on the cluster, all
cluster nodes must see it, optional&gt;<br />
 X.bin.env=&lt;semicolon separated list of environment variables
for executable, use hash symbol as name value separator,
optional&gt;<br />
 X.--aamatrix.path=&lt;path to the directory containing
substitution matrices, optional&gt;<br />
 X.presets.file=&lt;path to the preset configuration file, optional
&gt;<br />
 X.parameters.file=&lt;path to the parameters configuration file,
optional&gt;<br />
 X.limits.file=&lt;path to the limits configuration file,
optional&gt;<br />
 X.cluster.settings=&lt;list of the cluster specific options,
optional&gt;</span></p>

<p>Where X is either  clustal, muscle, mafft, probcons or tcoffee. </p>

<p>Default JABAWS configuration includes path to local executables
to be run by the local engine only, all cluster related settings
are commented out, but they are there for you as example. Cluster
engine is disabled by default. To configure executable for cluster
execution un comment the X.cluster settings and change them
appropriately. </p>
<p>By default limits are set well in excess of what you may want to offer to the users outside your lab, to make sure that the tasks are never rejected. The default limit is 100000 sequences of 100000 letters on average for all of the JABA web services.  You can adjust the limits according to your needs by editing <span class="hightlight">conf/settings/&lt;X&gt;Limit.xml</span> files.<br />
  After you have completed the editing your configuration may look like
  this:<span class="code">local.mafft.bin.windows=<br />
    local.mafft.bin=binaries/mafft<br />
    cluster.mafft.bin=/homes/cengine/mafft<br />
    mafft.bin.env=MAFFT_BINARIES#/homes/cengine/mafft;FASTA_4_MAFFT#/bin/fasta34;<br />
    mafft.--aamatrix.path=binaries/matrices<br />
    mafft.presets.file=conf/settings/MafftPresets.xml<br />
    mafft.parameters.file=conf/settings/MafftParameters.xml<br />
    mafft.limits.file=conf/settings/MafftLimits.xml<br />
    mafft.cluster.settings=-q bigmem.q -l h_cpu=24:00:00 -l
    h_vmem=6000M -l ram=6000M</span></p>
<p>Please not that relative paths must only be specified for the
files that reside inside web application directory, all other paths
must be supplied as absolute!</p>

<p>Furthermore, you should avoid using environment variables within the paths or options - since these will not be evaluated correctly.  Instead, please explicitly
specify the absolute path to anything
normally evaluated from an environment variable at execution time.</p>

<p>If you are using JABAWS to submit jobs to the cluster (with
cluster engine enabled), executables must be available from all
cluster nodes the task can be sent to, also paths to the
executables on the cluster e.g. <span class=
"hightlight">cluster.&lt;exec_name&gt;.bin</span> must be
absolute.</p>

<p>Executables can be located anywhere in your system, they do not
have to reside on the server as long as the web application server
can access and execute them.</p>

<p>Cluster settings are treated as a black box, the system will
just pass whatever is specified in this line directly to the
cluster submission library. This is how DRMAA itself treats this
settings. More exactly DRMAA <span class="hightlight">JobTemplate.setNativeSpecification()</span> function will be called.</p>

<h3><a name="setexecenv" />Defining Environment Variables for
Executables</h3>

<p>Environment variables can be defined in property <span class=
"code">x.bin.env</span> Where <span class="hightlight">x</span> is
one of five executables supported by JABAWS. Several environment
variables can be specified in the same line. For example.<br />
 <span class=
"code">mafft.bin.env=MAFFT_BINARIES#/homes/cengine/mafft;FASTA_4_MAFFT#/bin/fasta34;</span></p>

<p>The example above defines two environment variables with names
MAFFT-BINARIES and FASTA_4_MAFFT and values /homes/cengine/mafft
and /bin/fasta34 respectively. Semicolon is used as a separator
between different environment variables whereas hash is used as a
separator for name and value of the variable.</p>

<h3><a name="mafftconf" id="mafftconf"></a>Configure JABAWS to Work
with Mafft</h3>

<p>If you use default configuration you do not need to read any
further. The default configuration will work for you without any
changes, however, if you want to install Mafft yourself then there
is a couple of more steps to do.</p>

<p>Mafft executable needs to know the location of other files
supplied with Mafft. In addition some Mafft functions depends on
the fasta executable, which is not supplied with Mafft, but is a
separate package. Mafft needs to know the location of fasta34
executable.</p>

<p>To let Mafft know where the other files from its package are
change the value of MAFFT-BINARIES environment variables. To let
Mafft know where is the fasta34 executable set the value of
FASTA_4_MAFFT environment variable to point to a location of
fasta34 program. The latter can be added to the PATH variable
instead. If you are using executables supplied with JABAWS, the
path to Mafft binaries would be like <span class=
"hightlight">&lt;relative path to web application
directory&gt;/binaries/src/mafft/binaries</span> and the path to
fasta34 binary would be <span class="hightlight">&lt;relative path
to web application
directory&gt;/binaries/src/fasta34/fasta34</span>. You can specify
the location of Mafft binaries as well as fasta34 program elsewhere
by providing an absolute path to them. All these settings are
defined in <span class=
"hightlight">conf/Executable.properties</span> file.</p>
<h3><a name="settinglimit" id="settinglimit"></a>Limiting the size of the job accepted by JABAWS </h3>
<p>JABAWS can be configured to reject excessively large tasks.  This is useful if you operate JABAWS service for many users. By defining a  maximum allowed task size you can provide an even service for all users and  prevents waist of resources on the tasks too large to complete  successfully. You can define the maximum number of sequences and the maximum average  sequence length that JABAWS accepts for each JABA Web Service independently. 
Furthermore, you can define different limits for different  presets of the same web service. <br />
By default limits are set well in excess of what you may  want to offer to the users outside your lab, to make sure that the tasks are  never rejected. The default limit is 100000 sequences of 100000 letters on  average for all of the JABA web services. You can adjust the limits according  to your needs by editing <span class="hightlight">conf/settings/&lt;X&gt;Limit.xml</span> files.</p>
<h3><a name="diffbin" id="diffbin"></a>Using a different version of the alignment program with JABAWS</h3>
<p>JABAWS supplied with binaries and source code of the executables which version it supports. So normally you would not need to install your own executables. However, if you have a different version of an executable (e.g. an alignment program) which you prefer, you could use it as long as it supports all the functions JABAWS executable supported. This could be the case with more recent executable. If the options supported by your chosen executable is different when the standard JABAWS executable, than you need to edit <em>ExecutableName</em>Paramaters.xml&nbsp; configuration file. </p>
<h3><a name="mixuse" id="mixuse"></a>Load balancing </h3>
<p>If your cluster is busy and have significant waiting times you can achieve a faster response by allowing the server machine to calculate small tasks and the reserve the cluster for bigger jobs. This works especially well if your server is a powerful machine with many CPUs. To do this you need to enable and configure both the cluster and the local engines. Once this is done decide on the maximum size of a task to be run on the server locally. Then, edit <span class="hightlight">&quot;# LocalEngineExecutionLimit #&quot; </span>preset in<span class="hightlight"> &lt;ServiceName&gt;Limits.xml</span> file accordingly. JABAWS server then will balance the load according to the following rule: If the task size is smaller then the maximum task size for local engine, and the local engine has idle threads, then calculate task locally otherwise submit the task to the cluster. </p>
<h3><a name="testingJaba" id="testingJaba"></a>Testing JABA Web Services</h3>
<p>You can use a command line client (part of the client only
  package) to test your JABAWS installation as described <a href="man_client.html">here</a>. If you downloaded a JABAWS
  server package, you can use <span class=
"hightlight">&lt;your_jaba_context_name&gt;/WEB-INF/lib/jaba-client.jar</span> to test JABAWS installation as described in <a href=
"man_serverwar.html#usingWsTester">here</a>. If you downloaded the source
  code, then you could run a number of test suits defined in the
  build.xml Apache Ant  file.</p>
<h3><a name="logs" id="logs"></a>JABAWS requests logging </h3>
<p>Enable Tomcat log valve. To do this uncomment the following section of <span class="hightlight">&lt;tomcat_root&gt;/conf/server.xml</span> configuration file. </p>
<p class="code"> &lt;Valve className=&quot;org.apache.catalina.valves.AccessLogValve&quot; directory=&quot;logs&quot; <br />
  prefix=&quot;localhost_access_log.&quot; suffix=&quot;.txt&quot; pattern=&quot;common&quot; resolveHosts=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;</p>
<p> The following information will be logged:</p>
<table width="100%" border="0" style="margin:0">
  <tr>
    <th>Remote IP</th>
    <th>Date</th>
    <th>Method server_URL protocol </th>
    <th>HTTP status </th>
    <th>Response size in bytes </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>10.31.11.159</td>
    <td>[10/Feb/2010:16:51:32 +0000]</td>
    <td>&quot;POST /jws2/MafftWS HTTP/1.1&quot;</td>
    <td>200</td>
    <td>2067</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Which can be processed in various programs for log analysis , such as <a href="http://www.webalizer.org/">WebAlizer</a>, <a href="http://www.analog.cx/">Analog</a>, <a href="http://awstats.sourceforge.net/">AWStats</a>. </p>
<h3><a name="logfiles" id="logfiles"></a>JABAWS internal logging </h3>
<p>JABAWS can be configured to log what it is doing. This comes
  handy if you would like to see who is using your web services or
  need to chase some problems. JABAWS uses <a href=
"http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/">log4j</a> to do the logging,
  the example of log4j configuration is bundled with JABAWS war file.
  You will find it in the <span class=
"hightlight">/WEB-INF/classes/log4j.properties</span> file. All the
  lines in this file are commented out. The reason why the logging is
  disabled by default it simple, log4j have to know the exact
  location where the log files should be stored. This is not known up
  until the deployment time. To enable the logging you need to
  define<span class="hightlight"> logDir</span> property in the <span
class="hightlight">log4j.properties</span> and uncomment section of
  the file which corresponds to your need. More information is given
  in the <span class="hightlight">log4j.properties</span> file
  itself. Restart the Tomcat or the JABAWS web application to apply
  the settings.</p>
<p>After you have done this, assuming that you did not change the
  log4j.properties file yourself, you should see the application log
  file called <span class="hightlight">activity.log</span>. The
  amount of information logged can be adjusted using different
  logging levels, it is reduced in the following order of log levels
  TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL.</p>
<p>If you would like to know who is using your services, you might
  want to <a href="#logs">enable Tomcat request
    logging</a>.</p>
